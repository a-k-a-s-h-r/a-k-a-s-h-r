- About me:
- With a dynamic journey spanning over the years, I've traversed every facet of the software development lifecycle, refining my expertise from requirements analysis to comprehensive testing of web applications.
My forte lies in crafting immersive web experiences and robust web services using cutting-edge technologies like AngularJS/7/9/10/latest, and React.
I specialize in developing sophisticated client-server applications using C# .NET and ASP.NET, underpinned by a foundation of Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) principles.
My commitment to excellence is unwaveringâ€”I ensure the highest quality standards through meticulous unit testing and integration, leaving no critical use case unchecked.
